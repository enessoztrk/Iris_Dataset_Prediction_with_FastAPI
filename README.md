# Iris Dataset Prediction with FastAPI
## About this project:
It is now much easier with Fast API to know what types of iris flowers you see while walking are based on leaf and flower sizes ðŸŒ¸

With machine learning models, you can learn which type it belongs to with 96% accuracy.

The data set used to create the model includes classification data and type classes.

Some features of the dataset:
- 150 samples
- Balanced class distribution: 50 samples per class
- 3 labels: Iris species ( Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica and Iris-versicolor )
- 4 features: Sepal sizes, Petal sizes

Several popular classifiers have been created using the scikit-learn library, it has been observed that petal measurements are more useful than sepal ones in classifying samples. It has been made ready to be used in the live environment with the Fast API.ðŸ¥³

Project is live now and deployed on FastAPI. visit at https://www.kaggle.com/code/enesztrk/iris-dataset-prediction-with-fast-api

Perform dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.

Build various ML models that can predict iris species based on given dataset.
