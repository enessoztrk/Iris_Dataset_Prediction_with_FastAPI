# Iris Dataset Prediction with FastAPI
## About this project:
- This dataset contains information about iris species classification by sepal and petal size. Machine learning model is needed in order to classify the appropriate iris species based on sepal and petal size.
- Project is live now and deployed on fast api. visit at https://www.kaggle.com/code/enesztrk/iris-dataset-prediction-with-fast-api
- Perform dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
- Build various ML models that can predict iris species based on given dataset.
